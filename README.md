## Description 

The motivation behind this project was to have a portfolio to show case all of my work and knowledge. Within this project I have created links that will take the viewer to different pages of work that I have created. Creating this portfolio project has made it easier to combine all of my previous and furture work into a space that future employeers can easily navigate through. Throughout the process I learned how much detail goes into creating a personal portfolio and also allows one to showcase many skills within one website.



Lastly, if your project is deployed, include a link to the deployed application here.




## Usage
